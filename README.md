## How It Began:
- In my Classics 101 class, my instructor suggested us to use Anki to study Greek/Latin bases, prefixes, and suffixes.
- While there exist great flashcard/studying tools like Anki and Quizlet, I found them less approachable for quick or casual use.
- With the tools mentioned, it's always either that you have to register for an account, or download and configure a desktop, which I found to be very inconvenient.
- With this project, I wanted to create something lightweight and instant. A flashcard tool that runs entirely in the browser, requires no installation, and keeps the user's decks simple and portable.
- I also wanted to challenge myself by having no backend/database in this project, so that I must really think critically to create something unique and special with the limited set of tools provided.

## Why Should You Use It?:
- ‚ö° Lightweight, easy to use web-based flashcard application.
- üöÄ No need to create an account and log in, study right away.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Easily export & import flashcard sets to preverse or share with others.
- ‚ú® A somewhat modern & appealing website so you won't lose your mind.

## What's Next?:
- Perhaps a fun logo for the site ;).
- Feel free to suggest updates! As of right now, the state of the project is pretty much finished, but if you enjoy this tooling and would like me to add more features, please let me know!
