## Flashcard Project!
This project began in an effort for me to have an easy-to-use flashcard website, and also to have fun with TypeScript & React and any potential technology I may want to learn in the future!
I also wanted to challenge myself by having no backend in this project, so that I must really think critically to create something unique and special with the limited set of tools provided.

## Intention
- Lightweight, easy to use web-based flashcard application.
- No need to create an account and log in, study right away.
- Easily export & import flashcard sets.
- A somewhat appealing website so you won't lose your mind.

## TODOs
- Perhaps a fun logo for the site ;).
- Feel free to suggest TODOs!
