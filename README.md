## Flashcard Project!
This project began in an effort for me to have an easy-to-use flashcard website, and also to have fun with TypeScript & React and any potential technology I may want to learn in the future!

## Intention
- Lightweight, easy to use web-based flashcard application.
- No need to create an account and log in, study right away.
- Easily export & import flashcard sets.
- A somewhat appealing website so you won't lose your mind.

## Planned
- Basic flashcard website functionality, of course.
- Local storage (I am a big fan ðŸ˜„).
- Import & export flashcards.
- Dark/Light mode (a fun challenge to take on).
